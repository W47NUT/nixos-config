Option | Description
_module.args | Additional arguments passed to each module in addition to ones like lib, config, pkgs, and modulesPath.
vim.enableLuaLoader | The experimental Lua module loader to speed up the startup process.
vim.package | The Neovim package to use for the wrapper. This corresponds to the package that will be wrapped with your plugins and settings.
vim.additionalRuntimePaths | Additional runtime paths that will be appended to Neovimâ€™s active runtimepath. This can be used to add extra lookup paths for configs, plugins, etc.
vim.extraLuaFiles | Additional Lua files that will be sourced by Neovim (via the :luafile command). Warning: All provided paths must be valid, otherwise Neovim will error on startup.

Doesn't seem that it captured all of them
Oh well
midi â€” 11:00 PM
What's this?
You some how listed all of the options with their description or smth?
W47NUT â€” 11:01 PM
Not all of them but a good amount it seems
Took 30 minutes for chatgpt just to spit that out to me
I was trying to have it make a nice table but in pure chatgpt fashion I get something entire not what I thought I wanted. 
midi â€” 11:03 PM
You really did just vibe code this, huh?
midi â€” 11:04 PM
You should learn regex and sed
Why make a table anyways? You have a markdown page for it anyways
W47NUT â€” 11:04 PM
W47NUT â€” 11:05 PM
Easier for my eyes sometimes to have a table of them listed next to each other. Makes it easier to find something in a sea of something
The names are common enough for it
W47NUT â€” 11:13 PM
Hey i need your help
midi â€” 11:13 PM
What's up?
W47NUT â€” 11:14 PM
So you know on unixporn how people have those terminal programs that show off system statistics, bars, etc.

Aside from fastfetch do you know any of them off the top of your head? I want to show off to the students a lil' bit
midi â€” 11:15 PM
btop comes to mind 
I can send my config if you want
W47NUT â€” 11:16 PM
;o it needs configured eh?
midi â€” 11:16 PM
Not needs
But can be
I think mine is pretty damn good
W47NUT â€” 11:17 PM
Aight send that shit then fam
midi â€” 11:18 PM
Okay, sec. Flashing keyboard

It's the next thing smithay is working on
Last one was floating

I suspect we should have it by end of year
Maybe around summer time
But eh, I've seen them shit stuff out pretty quick surprisingly
So we'll see

oh should it just be vim
midi â€” 11:46 PM
Reboot
EDITOR should reset after logging in again

This isn't a recent change though
But I'll fuckin' do it
it fuckin' worked, aight. Â¯\_(ãƒ„)_/Â¯
midi â€” 11:49 PM
Told ya
I know this bitch man
I'll tell ya when it'll work with reboot or not
Been married to this system for 8 fucking years
